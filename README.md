## Getting started

Copying the repository

Due to the public nature of forks we suggest you duplicate the repo rather then forking it.
You will need to create your own repo e.g. `[your_github_username]/pokedex-app` and then clone this repo `luidcrua/pokedex-app` and push the code into your new one. You can follow the steps for doing this here: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/
